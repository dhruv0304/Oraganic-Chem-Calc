# Oraganic-Chem-Calc

This project was developed as part of ["Lighthouse Hacks" hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/organic-chemistry-calculator)

## Inspiration

Organic Chemistry is known to be a very challenging subject, especially during the pandemic. With limited help from teachers and with countless rules and combinations, we decided to make an organic Chemistry calculator that helps students with nomenclature.

## What is does 

All users have to do is input minimal/ simple information to the calculator such as "How many chains are in the diagram" and the calculator inputs this information through the algorithm and outputs the final answer.

## How we built it

Using python, we first created the organic chemistry algorithm. We followed all the rules taught in class and then implemented the code in a way so users do not have to do any rough work. Once the algorithm was complete, we then implemented the code into a graphical user interface so the experience can be pleasant and organized.

##Challenges we ran into

With so many rules and ambiguous cases, we found difficulty in making the algorithm since there are so many combinations of rules to follow with nomenclature.

## What we learned

We learned how to implement two different parts of designing such as a back end and front end. This allowed us to understand that we can create a product as long as we can create a beautiful package to represent the code.
